### Hi there!

I'm Alex, a CS student currently studying at UVA. My interests in software are all over the place, but here on my Github you'll find mostly frontend projects. Don't get the wrong idea thoughâ€”I can do more than center a div.

This semester, I've been learning PHP and Rust. Last semester, I was working on [Floodwatch](http://floodwatch.io), an ML-powered flood prediction platform, for which I'm currently leading frontend and API development. Next, I'll be diving deeper into some more lower level programming with C++ and Zig. 

If you're looking to contact me, the best way is probably through email at [xrk4np@virginia.edu](mailto:xrk4np@virginia.edu), my university email address.
